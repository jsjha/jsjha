## 🗽 Hello! ☀️ ¡Hola! 🥐 Bonjour! 🌙 !مرحبا 

I am a senior at the University of Pennsylvania pursuing a BSE in Electrical Engineering. 🎓

### About Me

🔡 I enjoy studying languages! I speak Spanish, and I am currently learning French and Arabic! I am also co-developing a language learning app called Languify, more details to come!

⚙️ Most of my projects are related to embedded systems, I have created a motion-controlled robotic arm, joystick controlled pong, and distance-based synthesizer utilizing bare-metal C and various communication protocals such as UART, I2C, and Wifi. 

💡 I am looking to expand my software and data analysis experience, especially as it relates to foreign policy and diplomatic relations, as I am interested in learning more about how technology can be utilized in these fields!
